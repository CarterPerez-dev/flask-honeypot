## 10. Migration Challenges

Let's address some challenges you might face when packaging your honeypot system:

### 10.1 Database Dependencies

Your system uses MongoDB extensively. The package should:

1. Provide clear documentation on MongoDB requirements
2. Include proper error handling for when MongoDB isn't available
3. Allow users to configure MongoDB connection details
4. Support optional database backends in the future

### 10.2 GeoIP Database

The system uses MaxMind GeoIP databases:

1. Include mechanisms to download and update these databases
2. Handle cases where the license key isn't provided
3. Gracefully handle missing or outdated databases

### 10.3 Frontend Integration

Since your frontend is React-based:

1. Provide compiled JS/CSS files for users who aren't using React
2. Include source components for those who want to integrate with their React apps
3. Document how to customize and extend the frontend

### 10.4 Security Considerations

For a security-focused package:

1. Ensure default settings are secure
2. Validate configuration parameters
3. Include proper security headers and CSRF protection
4. Document security best practices for deployment

## Conclusion

This comprehensive guide provides a detailed roadmap for extracting your honeypot system into a reusable Python package. By following these steps, you'll create a flexible, maintainable package that others can easily integrate into their security infrastructure.

The package structure respects your existing architecture while making it more modular and configurable. The examples and documentation will help users quickly get started with your powerful honeypot framework.
